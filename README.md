Jump Ability - Screw Kick

A combination of Sonia's Spin Kick and Samus' Screw Attack.
Pressing the jump button allows you to perform basically a super powered insta-shield that lasts until you touch the ground again. As with insta-shield, you always have attack priority over everything. The catch to this however, is that you fall faster so it's harder to do combos. When pulling off combos, white flash effects will act as a hit counter (https://twitter.com/newtrogicpanic/status/1511607728904744960?s=21&t=l1dOlr4VkpU2QqSl53LJcQ). To put it in simpler terms, Think Charged Drop Dash fron SK Newtrogic Panic but without the Drop Dash part. Activating the ability causes you to do a small double jump so it can be used as a traversal method as well.

Passive Ability - Lightning Dash

When running quickly, lightning sparks are created and you are able to damage enemies by ramming them. Think Strike Dash from Sonic Triple Trouble but only when you are running very fast (No Super Peel-Out). When entering water, you make it flash and destroy anything in it like entering water with a Lightning Shield. When you have a Lightning Shield, the move is stronger and can be used at normal running speeds.

Surge cannot use Shield abilities.
